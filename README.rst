`Mesa`_ is an Apache2 licensed agent-based modeling (or ABM) framework in Python.

It allows users to quickly create agent-based models using built-in core components (such as spatial grids and agent schedulers) or customized implementations; visualize them using a browser-based interface; and analyze their results using Python's data analysis tools. Its goal is to be the Python 3-based alternative to NetLogo, Repast, or MASON.
