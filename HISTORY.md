# 3.1.3 (2025-01-11)
## Highlights
Mesa 3.1.3 introduces a major experimental reimplementation of Mesa's continuous space, providing an intuitive agent-centric API and significant performance improvements. The new implementation supports n-dimensional spaces and offers streamlined methods for agent movement and neighbor calculations.

### New Continuous Space Features
- Agent-centric movement API similar to cell spaces
- Efficient neighbor calculations and position updates
- Support for n-dimensional spaces
- Improved memory management with dynamic array resizing

Here's a quick look at the new API:

```python
# Create a 2D continuous space
space = ContinuousSpace(
    dimensions=[[0, 1], [0, 1]],
    torus=True,
    random=model.random
)

# Create and position an agent
agent = ContinuousSpaceAgent(space, model)
agent.position = [0.5, 0.5]

# Move agent using vector arithmetic
agent.position += [0.1, 0.1]

# Get neighbors within radius
neighbors, distances = agent.get_neighbors_in_radius(radius=0.2)

# Find k nearest neighbors
nearest, distances = agent.get_nearest_neighbors(k=5)
```

The new implementation particularly benefits models requiring frequent position updates and neighbor queries, such as flocking simulations or particle systems. See [#2584](https://github.com/projectmesa/mesa/pull/2584) for more details. We would love to get feedback on the new Continuous Space in [#2611](https://github.com/projectmesa/mesa/discussions/2611).

Other improvements in this release include consistent visualization behavior across space types with the reimplementation of `draw_voronoi` [#2608](https://github.com/projectmesa/mesa/pull/2608), and a new render interval slider for controlling visualization update frequency in SolaraViz, which helps improve performance when working with complex visualizations [#2596](https://github.com/projectmesa/mesa/pull/2596). We've also fixed a bug affecting random number generation determinism when using `Model(seed=something)`, ensuring both `model.random` and `model.rng` now behave consistently when seeded with the same initial value [#2598](https://github.com/projectmesa/mesa/pull/2598).

# 3.1.1 (2024-12-14)
## Highlights
Mesa 3.1.1 is a maintenance release that includes visualization improvements and documentation updates. The key enhancement is the addition of an interactive play interval control to the visualization interface, allowing users to dynamically adjust simulation speed between 1ms and 500ms through a slider in the Controls panel.

Several example models were updated to use Mesa 3.1's recommended practices, particularly the `create_agents()` method for more efficient agent creation and NumPy's `rng.integers()` for random number generation. The Sugarscape example was modernized to use PropertyLayers.

Bug fixes include improvements to PropertyLayer visualization and a correction to the Schelling model's neighbor similarity calculation. The tutorials were also updated to reflect current best practices in Mesa 3.1.

# 3.1.0 (2024-12-04)
## Highlights
With Mesa 3.1.0 we're back on our regular release schedule after the big Mesa 3.0 release, with some exciting new features.

This release adds experimental support for Observables and Computed, enabling a more reactive and responsive programming model for agent-based simulations. The new `Observable` and `Computable` classes allow developers to declaratively define attributes that automatically emit signals when their values change, and compute derived values that update dynamically. This lays the groundwork for more advanced event handling and data visualization features in future releases (#2291).

The experimental cell space module has been updated with full support for n-dimensional property layers. These allow agents to easily interact with and modify spatial properties of the environment, such as terrain, resources, or environmental conditions. The new implementation provides a more intuitive attribute-based API and ensures tight integration with the cell space architecture (#2512).

Mesa now includes built-in support for logging using the standard Python `logging` module. This provides developers with a flexible and powerful way to add structured diagnostic and debug output to their simulations, without the need for custom logging solutions. The logging system is integrated throughout the library, including the new SolaraViz visualization system (#2506).

Creating multiple agents with varying initialization parameters is now significantly easier with the new `Agent.create_agents` class method. This factory function supports both uniform and per-agent parameters, simplifying the code required to set up a simulation with a large number of heterogeneous agents (#2351).

In addition to the major new features, this release includes a number of smaller enhancements and bug fixes that improve the overall developer experience. These include removing deprecated functionality, cleaning up examples, and addressing various edge cases reported by the community. Mesa 3.1 requires Python 3.11 or higher.

**Full Changelog**: https://github.com/projectmesa/mesa/compare/v3.0.0...v3.0.1

# 3.0.0 (2024-11-09)
## Highlights
Mesa 3.0 brings major improvements to agent-based modeling, making it more intuitive and powerful while reducing complexity. This release modernizes core functionalities and introduces new capabilities for both beginners and advanced users.

### Streamlined agent management
The centerpiece of Mesa 3.0 is its new agent management system. Agents are now automatically tracked and assigned unique IDs, eliminating common boilerplate code. The new AgentSet functionality provides an elegant and flexible way to work with agents, for example:

```python
# Find agents meeting specific criteria
wealthy_agents = model.agents.select(lambda a: a.wealth > 1000)

# Group and analyze agents
grouped = model.agents.groupby("state")
state_stats = grouped.agg({
     "count": len,
     "avg_age": ("age", np.mean),
     "total_wealth": ("wealth", sum)
 })

# Activate agents in different patterns
model.agents.shuffle_do("step")  # Random activation
model.agents.select(lambda a: a.energy > 0).do("move")  # Conditional activation
```

The AgentSet provides powerful methods for filtering, grouping, and analyzing agents, making it easier to express complex model logic. Each model automatically maintains an AgentSet containing all agents (`model.agents`) and separate AgentSets for each agent type (`model.agents_by_type`). See the full [AgentSet docs](https://mesa.readthedocs.io/latest/apis/agent.html#mesa.agent.AgentSet) here.

### Modern Visualization with SolaraViz
Mesa 3.0's new experimental visualization system, SolaraViz, provides a modern, interactive interface for model exploration:

```python
from mesa.visualization import SolaraViz, make_space_component, make_plot_component

visualization = SolaraViz(
    model,
    [
        make_space_component(agent_portrayal),
        make_plot_component(["population", "average_wealth"]),
        lambda m: f"Step {m.steps}: {len(m.agents)} agents"  # Custom text component
    ],
    model_params=parameter_controls
)
```

Key visualization features:
- Interactive browser-based interface with real-time updates
- Support for both grid-based and network models
- Visualization of PropertyLayers and hexagonal grids
- Custom components using Matplotlib or text
- Improved performance and responsiveness

Check out the [Visualization Tutorial](https://mesa.readthedocs.io/latest/tutorials/visualization_tutorial.html) to get started.

*Note: SolaraViz is in active development. We might make API breaking changes between Mesa 3.0 and 3.1.*

### Enhanced data collection
The DataCollector now supports collecting different metrics for different agent types, using  `agenttype_reporters`:

```python
self.datacollector = DataCollector(
    model_reporters={"total_wealth": lambda m: m.agents.agg("wealth", sum)},
    agent_reporters={"age": "age", "wealth": "wealth"},
    agenttype_reporters={
        Predator: {"kills": "kills_count"},
        Prey: {"distance_fled": "total_flight_distance"}
    }
)
```

### Experimental features
Mesa 3.0 introduces several experimental features for advanced modeling:
- [Cell Space](https://mesa.readthedocs.io/latest/apis/experimental.html#module-experimental.cell_space.cell) with integrated PropertyLayers and improved agent movement capabilities
- Voronoi grid implementation
- [Event-scheduling simulation](https://mesa.readthedocs.io/latest/apis/experimental.html#module-experimental.devs.eventlist) capabilities

These experimental features are in active development and might break API between releases.

## Breaking changes
_See our [Mesa 3.0 migration guide](https://mesa.readthedocs.io/latest/migration_guide.html#mesa-3-0) for a full overview._

If you want to move existing models from Mesa 2.x to 3.0, there are a few things you have to change.

1. Models must explicitly initialize the Mesa base class:
```python
class MyModel(mesa.Model):
    def __init__(self, n_agents, seed=None):
        super().__init__(seed=seed)  # Required in Mesa 3.0
```

2. Agents are created without manual ID assignment:
```python
# Old
agent = MyAgent(unique_id=1, model=self)
# New
agent = MyAgent(model=self)
```

3. Scheduler replacement with AgentSet operations:
```python
# Old (RandomActivation)
self.schedule = RandomActivation(self)
self.schedule.step()

# New
self.agents.shuffle_do("step")

# Old (SimultaneousActivation)
self.schedule = SimultaneousActivation(self)
self.schedule.step()

# New
self.agents.do("step")
self.agents.do("advance")
```

Furthermore:
- Steps counter automatically increments
- `mesa.flat` namespace removed
- Python 3.10+ required
- Reserved model variables (`agents`, `steps`, etc.) protected
- Simplified DataCollector initialization
- Old visualization system replaced by SolaraViz

## Getting Started
Install Mesa 3.0:
```bash
pip install --upgrade mesa
```

If building a new model, we recommend checking out the updated [Mesa Overview](https://mesa.readthedocs.io/latest/overview.html) and [Introductory Tutorial](https://mesa.readthedocs.io/latest/tutorials/intro_tutorial.html).

For updating existing models, we recommend upgrading in steps:
1. Update to latest Mesa 2.x
2. Address deprecation warnings
3. Upgrade to Mesa 3.0
4. Replace schedulers with AgentSet functionality

A detailed [migration guide](https://mesa.readthedocs.io/latest/migration_guide.html#mesa-3-0) is available to help moving to Mesa 3.0. For questions or support, join our [GitHub Discussions](https://github.com/projectmesa/mesa/discussions) or [Matrix Chat](https://matrix.to/#/#project-mesa:matrix.org).

We would love to hear what you think about Mesa 3.0! [Say hello here](https://github.com/projectmesa/mesa/discussions/2465) and leave any [feedback on 3.0 here](https://github.com/projectmesa/mesa/discussions/2338).

# 3.0.0rc0 (2024-11-06)
## Highlights
We're releasing the Mesa 3.0 Release Candidate, ready for final testing before we release Mesa 3.0 later this week!

In this last 3.0 pre-release, the visualisation has been thoroughly updated, with a brand new API. Visualizing the experimental Cell Space, including PropertyLayers and hexogonal grids, is now also supported.

We're still working very active on the visualisation, so we have marked that experimental for Mesa 3.0. We will stabilize SolaraViz in Mesa 3.1.

Any feedback and last-minute bug reports are welcome [here](https://github.com/projectmesa/mesa/discussions/2338).

# 3.0.0b2 (2024-10-26)
## Highlights
Mesa 3.0 beta 2 includes major work on the example models, docs, a new tutorial and visualisation.

The included example models are now part of the Mesa package itself and directly importable, using:
```Python
from mesa.examples import BoidFlockers, BoltzmannWealthModel, ConwaysGameOfLife, ...
```
The advanced examples were also restructured and cleaned up.

The tutorial was completely rewritten for Mesa 3.0, including it's latest features and practices. Many of our other docs also received some love, and almost everything is now ready for Mesa 3.0.

A new feature to remove all agents from the model was added, and the visualisation now supports drawing the experimental discrete spaces in both matplotlib and altair. All agents which are in a space can now conveniently be accessed with `.agents`.

The rarely used `mesa startproject` cookiecutter feature was removed. We updated our best-practice guide to include how to structure a modern Mesa project, which is now very straightforward.

# 3.0.0b1 (2024-10-17)
## Highlights
Mesa 3.0 beta 1 is our last beta release before the Mesa 3.0 stable release. We are restructuring our examples and have move 9 core examples from [mesa-examples](https://github.com/projectmesa/mesa-examples) to mesa itself ([#2358](https://github.com/projectmesa/mesa/pull/2358)). The 5 basic examples are now directly importable ([#2381](https://github.com/projectmesa/mesa/pull/2381)):
```Python
from examples.basic import BoidFlockers, BoltzmannWealthModel, ConwaysGameOfLife, Schelling, VirusOnNetwork
```
The 5 basic examples will always use stable Mesa features, we are also working on 4 more advanced example which can also include experimental features.

All our core examples can now be viewed in the [`examples`](https://github.com/projectmesa/mesa/tree/main/examples) folder. [mesa-examples](https://github.com/projectmesa/mesa-examples) will continue to exists for user showcases. We're also working on making the examples visible in the ReadtheDocs ([#2382](https://github.com/projectmesa/mesa/pull/2382)) and on an website ([mesa-examples#139](https://github.com/projectmesa/mesa-examples/issues/139)). Follow all our work on the examples in this tracking issue [#2364](https://github.com/projectmesa/mesa/issues/2364).

Furthermore, the visualizations are improved by making visualization elements scalable and more clearly labeling the plots, and the Model now has an `rng` argument for an [SPEC 7](https://scientific-python.org/specs/spec-0007/) compliant NumPy random number generator ([#2352](https://github.com/projectmesa/mesa/pull/2352)). Following SPEC 7, you have to pass either `seed` or `rng`. Whichever one you pass will be used to seed both `random.Random`, and `numpy.random.Generator.`

# 3.0.0b0 (2024-10-04)
## Highlights
We're proud to release the first Mesa 3.0 beta! This pre-release announces that we're ready for Mesa 3.0 to be tested by all our regular users. We try to not making breaking changes anymore, but focus on resolving bugs and imperfections.

In this beta, not so much has changed as in the alphas (we're stabilizing, that's a good sign), but there are still a few notable things:
- Agents now have to be initialized without their `unique_id`. See [#2328](https://github.com/projectmesa/mesa/pull/2328) and the [Migration guide](https://mesa.readthedocs.io/latest/migration_guide.html#automatic-assignment-of-unique-id-to-agents).
- PropertyLayers can now be visualized! See [#2336](https://github.com/projectmesa/mesa/pull/2336) for details and some examples, and [mesa-examples#214](https://github.com/projectmesa/mesa-examples/pull/214) as a simple example model.
- We reduced the core dependencies of Mesa, so that's a lighter and simpler install. You can now use extras to install the dependencies, for example add `[viz]` to install all visualisation dependencies: `pip install -U --pre mesa[viz]`. See [#2265](https://github.com/projectmesa/mesa/pull/2265) for details.
- The [Mesa Overview](https://mesa.readthedocs.io/latest/overview.html) as fully updated for 3.0. We highly recommend reading though it!
- We made some more progress on the experimental Cell Space, adding movement and integrating the PropertyLayer. Among others, Agents have nu initial movement capabilities for grids. Development continues during the betas and

We plan to release one or two more beta's in the coming weeks, and tag a release candidate and Mesa 3.0 late October. In the [v3.0 milestone](https://github.com/projectmesa/mesa/milestone/43) are the critical items on our todo-list.

You can install this pre-release as usual with:

```bash
pip install --upgrade --pre mesa
```
We're very curious what you think, try it out and ask any questions or share any feedback [here](https://github.com/projectmesa/mesa/discussions/2338)!

**Full Changelog**: https://github.com/projectmesa/mesa/compare/v3.0.0a5...v3.0.0b0

# 3.0.0a5 (2024-09-21)
## Highlights
Mesa v3.0 alpha 5 release contains many quality of life updates, a big new feature for the DataCollector and a major deprecation.

The entire `mesa.time` module, including all schedulers, has been deprecated ([#2306](https://github.com/projectmesa/mesa/pull/2306)). Users are encouraged to transition to AgentSet functionality for more flexible and explicit agent activation patterns. Check the [migration guide](https://mesa.readthedocs.io/latest/migration_guide.html#time-and-schedulers) on how to upgrade.

The DataCollector now supports collecting data from specific Agent subclasses using the new `agenttype_reporters` parameter ([#2300](https://github.com/projectmesa/mesa/pull/2300)). This allows collecting different metrics for different agent types. For example:

```python
self.datacollector = DataCollector(
    agenttype_reporters={
        Wolf: {"sheep_eaten": "sheep_eaten"},
        Sheep: {"wool": "wool_amount"}
    }
)
```

Furthermore, a new `shuffle_do()` method for AgentSets provides a faster way to perform `shuffle().do()` ([#2283](https://github.com/projectmesa/mesa/pull/2283)). The GroupBy class gained `count()` and `agg()` methods to count the number of agents in groups and aggregate variables of them ([#2290](https://github.com/projectmesa/mesa/pull/2290)).

In the experimental Cell Space, the `CellCollection.select` method was updated to use `at_most` instead of `n`, aligning with the AgentSet API ([#2307](https://github.com/projectmesa/mesa/pull/2307)). Additionally, the Cell class now features a dedicated `neighborhood` property for direct neighbors (default radius=1) and a `get_neighborhood` method for larger radii ([#2309](https://github.com/projectmesa/mesa/pull/2309)).

Finally, SolaraViz received updates improving its interface and performance ([#2299](https://github.com/projectmesa/mesa/pull/2299), [#2304](https://github.com/projectmesa/mesa/pull/2304)). Cell connections in grids and networks are now public and named for more intuitive agent movements ([#2296](https://github.com/projectmesa/mesa/pull/2296)). The Model class initialization process was simplified by moving random seed and random object creation to `__init__` ([#1940](https://github.com/projectmesa/mesa/pull/1940)). Documentation has been extensively updated, including enforcing Google docstrings ([#2294](https://github.com/projectmesa/mesa/pull/2294)) and reorganizing the API documentation ([#2298](https://github.com/projectmesa/mesa/pull/2298)) for better clarity and navigation.

While the Mesa 3.0 timeline is still being discussed, we're aiming at the first Mesa 3.0 beta in October followed by a stable release in November. Testing new features and sharing feedback is appreciated!

**Full Changelog**: https://github.com/projectmesa/mesa/compare/v3.0.0a4...v3.0.0a5

# 3.0.0a4 (2024-09-09)
## Highlights
Mesa 3.0.0a4 contains two major breaking changes:
1. The Agent's `unique_id` is now automatically assigned, so doesn't need to be passed to the Agent class anymore. In a subclassed custom Agent, like normally used, this now looks like this:
    ```diff
    class Wolf(Agent):
    -    def __init__(self, unique_id, model, energy=None):
    +    def __init__(self, model, energy=None):
            # When initializing the super class (Agent), passing unique_id isn't needed anymore
    -        super().__init__(unique_id, model)
    +        super().__init__(model)

    - wolf = Wolf(unique_id, model)
    + wolf = Wolf(model)
    ```
    Example models were updated in [mesa-examples#194](https://github.com/projectmesa/mesa-examples/pull/194), which shows more examples on how to update existing models.

2. Our visualisation API is being overhauled, to be more flexible and powerful. For more details, see [#2278](https://github.com/projectmesa/mesa/pull/2278).
    - An initial update to the tutorial was made in [#2289](https://github.com/projectmesa/mesa/pull/2289) and is [available here](https://mesa.readthedocs.io/latest/tutorials/visualization_tutorial.html).
    - An initial example model was updated in [mesa-examples#195](https://github.com/projectmesa/mesa-examples/pull/195), and more examples will be updated in [mesa-examples#195](https://github.com/projectmesa/mesa-examples/pull/193).
    - The old SolaraViz API is still available at `mesa.experimental`, but might be removed in future releases.

Furthermore, the AgentSet has a new `agg` method to quickly get an aggerate value (for example `min_energy = model.agents.agg("energy", min)`) ([#2266](https://github.com/projectmesa/mesa/pull/2266)), The Model `get_agents_of_type` function is replaced by directly exposing the `agents_by_type` property (which can be accessed as a dict) ([#2267](https://github.com/projectmesa/mesa/pull/2267), [mesa-examples#190](https://github.com/projectmesa/mesa-examples/pull/190)) and the AgentSet get() methods can now handle missing values by replacing it with a default value ([#2279](https://github.com/projectmesa/mesa/pull/2279)).

Finally, it fixes a bug in which the Grid's `move_agent_to_one_of` method with `selection="closest"` selected a location deterministically, instead of randomly ([#2118](https://github.com/projectmesa/mesa/pull/2118)).

**Full Changelog**: https://github.com/projectmesa/mesa/compare/v3.0.0a3...v3.0.0a4

# 3.0.0a3 (2024-08-30)
## Highlights
Developments toward Mesa 3.0 are steaming ahead, and our fourth alpha release is packed with features and updates - only 8 days after our third.

Mesa 3.0.0a3 contains one breaking change: We now automatically increase the `steps` counter by one at the beginning of each `Model.steps()` call. That means increasing `steps` by hand isn't necessary anymore.

The big new features is the experimental Voronoi grid that @vitorfrois implemented in #2084. It allows creating cells in a [Voronoi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voronoi_diagram) layout as part of the experimental cell space. An example using it to model Cholera spread can be [found here](https://github.com/projectmesa/mesa-examples/pull/118).

The AgentSet got a lot of love with two brand new methods: `.groupby()` to split in groups (#2220) and `.set()` to easily assign variables to all agents in that set (#2254). The `select()` method is improved by allowing to select at most a fraction of the agents (#2253), and we split the `do()` method in `do()` and `map()` to make a distinction between the return types (#2237).

Furthermore, we improved the performance of accessing `Model.agents`, squashed a bug in SolaraViz, started testing on Python 3.13 and added a new benchmark model.

Our example models also got more love: We removed the `RandomActivation` scheduler in 14 models and removed SimultaneousActivation in 3 models ([examples#183](https://github.com/projectmesa/mesa-examples/pull/183)). They now use the automatic step increase and AgentSet functionality. We started testing our GIS model in CI ([examples#171](https://github.com/projectmesa/mesa-examples/pull/171)) and resolved a lot of bugs in them ([examples#172](https://github.com/projectmesa/mesa-examples/issues/172), help appreciated!).

Finally, we have two brand new examples: An Ant Colony Optimization model using an Ant System approach to the Traveling Salesman problem, a Mesa NetworkGrid, and a custom visualisation with SolaraViz ([examples#157](https://github.com/projectmesa/mesa-examples/pull/157) by @zjost). The first example using the `PropertyLayer` was added, a very fast implementation of Conway's Game of Life ([examples#182](https://github.com/projectmesa/mesa-examples/pull/182)).

To help the transition to Mesa 3.0, we started writing a [migration guide](https://mesa.readthedocs.io/latest/migration_guide.html). Progress is tracked in #2233, feedback and help is appreciated! Finally, we also added a new section to our [contributor guide](https://github.com/projectmesa/mesa/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md#i-have-no-idea-where-to-start) to get new contributors up to speed.

This pre-release can be installed as always with `pip install --pre mesa`

# 3.0.0a2 (2024-08-21)
## Highlights
In Mesa 3.0 alpha 2 (`v3.0.0a2`) we've done more clean-up in preparation for Mesa 3.0. We now [require](https://github.com/projectmesa/mesa/pull/2218) `super().__init__()`  to run on initializing a Mesa model subclass, `Model.agents` is now fully reserved for the Model's internal AgentSet and we fixed a bug in our Solara space_drawer.

A new feature was added in [#2219](https://github.com/projectmesa/mesa/pull/2219), which now also allows `AgentSet.do()` to take any callable function, instead of only a string referencing to an Agent method. The argument name was changed from `method_name` to `method`.

The new Solara visualisation now allows portraying agents in different shapes, checkout some examples in [#2214](https://github.com/projectmesa/mesa/pull/2214).

We're also working hard on our [example models](https://github.com/projectmesa/mesa-examples). All model warnings were [resolved](https://github.com/projectmesa/mesa-examples/pull/153) and we've [replaced](https://github.com/projectmesa/mesa-examples/pull/161) a lot of schedulers with simpler and more flexible AgentSet functionality. Checkout our [open issues](https://github.com/projectmesa/mesa-examples/issues) if you want to help improve our example models further!

## Highlights
Mesa 3.0 alpha 1 (`v3.0.0a1`) is another step towards our next major version. This release introduces a name change from JupyterViz (jupyter_viz) to SolaraViz (solara_viz), to better represent the tech stack being used. It also includes two bugfixes also present in 2.3.2.

**Full Changelog**: https://github.com/projectmesa/mesa/compare/v3.0.0a0...v3.0.0a1

# 3.0.0a0 (2024-07-04)
## Highlights
This is the first pre-release in the Mesa 3.0 series, which is still in active development. The `v3.0.0a0` pre-release can help active Mesa developers help starting to test the latest features in their models.

Since it's in active development, more breaking changes may follow and it's not recommended for general usage.

There are two major breaking changes at this point:
- The old visualisation is removed, in favor of the new, Solara based, Jupyter Viz. This was already available in the 2.3.x release series, but is now stabilized. Checkout out our new [Visualization Tutorial](https://mesa.readthedocs.io/latest/tutorials/visualization_tutorial.html). More examples and a migration guide will follow later in the Mesa 3.0 development.
- The `mesa.flat` namespace is removed, since was not used very often.

Mesa 3.0 will require Python 3.10+.

This pre-release can be installed with `pip install mesa --upgrade --pre`.

# 2.3.0 (2024-04-23)
## Highlights
Mesa 2.3.0 is a big feature release and the last feature release before 3.0.

There are two main new features:
- The experimental cell-centric discrete spaces, as added in #1994. It allows having cells with not only properties but also active behaviors: the `CellAgent`. Its inspired by NetLogo's [patches](https://ccl.northwestern.edu/netlogo/bind/primitive/patches.html) but extend and generalize this concept further.
- Full support for discrete event scheduling, as added in #2066. It allows scheduling events (like Agent actions) at any time, including non-integer timesteps.

There are a lot of other features: The Jupyter visualisation now supports easier way to specify sliders, `NetworkGrid.get_neighbors()` supports a radius, `AgentSet.get()` can retrieve multiple attributes and there are now benchmarks to track Mesa performance during development.

Finally, 2.3.0 stabilizes the `AgentSet` (including `model.agents`), making it the first experimental Mesa feature that is taken out of it's experimental phase.

Install this release with:
```
pip install --upgrade mesa
```
The Mesa 2.3.x-series supports Python 3.9 to 3.12. The next major release will require Python 3.10.

**Full Changelog**: https://github.com/projectmesa/mesa/compare/v2.2.4...2.3.0

# 2.3.0-rc1 (2024-04-18)
Mesa 2.3.0-rc1 is pre-release in preparation for 2.3.0 stable. It had the same release notes as 2.3.0.

# 2.2.4 (2024-01-26)
## Highlights
Mesa v2.2.4 is a small but important bugfix release for the 2.2 release series. It fixes an essential bug in where agents weren't shuffled in the `BaseScheduler`, affecting mainly the `RandomActivation` scheduler (effectively making it sequential activation)([#2007](https://github.com/projectmesa/mesa/pull/2007)). It also fixes a small behaviour change in `RandomActivationByType.agents_by_type()` ([#1996](https://github.com/projectmesa/mesa/pull/1996)). Furthermore, this release adds an internal clock to the `Model`, which allows to use a Mesa model without a scheduler (using the `AgentSet` API)([#1942](https://github.com/projectmesa/mesa/pull/1942)).

Updating from previous 2.2 releases is highly recommended, especially when using the `RandomActivation` scheduler.

## What's Changed
### 🛠 Enhancements made
* refactor: Remove dependence on model.schedule, add clock to Model by @rht in https://github.com/projectmesa/mesa/pull/1942
### 🐛 Bugs fixed
* Fix AgentSet inplace shuffle (and thus RandomActivation), add tests by @EwoutH and @quaquel in https://github.com/projectmesa/mesa/pull/2007
* fix: Reverse dict key and value for agents_by_type by @rht in https://github.com/projectmesa/mesa/pull/1996

**Full Changelog**: https://github.com/projectmesa/mesa/compare/v2.2.2...v2.2.3

# 2.2.2 (2024-01-22)

## Highlights

Mesa 2.2.2 is a small bugfix release, for models in which users had defined  `Model.agents` (`self.agents` in a Model (sub)class). This is deprecated, but for now allowed. See [#1919 (comment)](https://github.com/projectmesa/mesa/discussions/1919#discussioncomment-8141844).

## What's Changed
### 🐛 Bugs fixed
* Allow user models to assign `Model.agents` for now, but add warning by @quaquel in [#1976](https://github.com/projectmesa/mesa/pull/1976)

**Full Changelog**: https://github.com/projectmesa/mesa/compare/v2.2.1...v2.2.2


# 2.2.1 (2024-01-16)

## Highlights
After the huge 2.2.0 release we are releasing 2.2.1 which addresses a few bugs, unintended behaviors and a performance regression. #1960 makes sure agent addition and removal is handled correct, #1965 fixed an unintended behavior change in `RandomActivationByType.agents_by_type` and #1964 makes sure we're at least as fast as before 2.2.0, if not faster. The [introduction tutorial](https://mesa.readthedocs.io/en/stable/tutorials/intro_tutorial.html) is also extended with #1955.

We highly recommend updating to 2.2.1 if you're using 2.2.0.

**Full Changelog**: https://github.com/projectmesa/mesa/compare/v2.2.0...v2.2.1


# 2.2.0 (2024-01-09)

## Highlights
The 2.2.0 release of the Mesa library introduces several updates and new features for managing and scheduling agents and modelling the environment, along with an experimental release policy aimed at enhancing development speed and community feedback. Below are key highlights of the new (experimental) features in this release. Mesa 2.2.0 supports Python 3.9+.

Despite the minor version number, this is one of our biggest releases yet.

### Experimental feature policy (discussion #1909)
This release introduces an experimental feature policy aimed at accelerating development and gathering community feedback. Features like #1890, #1898, and #1916 are marked as experimental under this policy.

**Policy overview:**
- Experimental features can be added or changed in any release, even patch releases.
- They don’t need a diligent review for every change, allowing for quicker development cycles.
- Community feedback is encouraged through discussion threads.

### Native support for multiple Agent types (PR #1894)
This update introduces a `agents` variable to the Mesa `Model` class, offering a first step in supporting multiple agent types as first class citizens. Each `Model` is now initialized with an `self.agents` variable (an `AgentSet`) in which all the agents are tracked. You can now always ask which agents are in the model with `model.agents`. It's the foundation which will allow us to solve problems with scheduling, data collection and visualisation of multiple agent types in the future.

### 🧪 AgentSet class (PR #1916)
The new `AgentSet` class encapsulates and manages collections of agents, streamlining the process of selecting, sorting, and applying actions to groups of agents.

**Key features:**
- Flexible and efficient agent management and manipulation.
- Methods like `select`, `shuffle`, `sort`, and `do` for intuitive operations.

**Example:**
```Python
# Applying a method to each agent
model.agents.do('step')

# Filtering and shuffling agents
shuffled_agents = model.agents.select(lambda agent: agent.attribute > threshold).shuffle()
```
_The AgentSet is an experimental feature. We would love feedback on it in #1919._

### 🧪 PropertyLayer and _PropertyGrid (PR #1898)
The introduction of `PropertyLayer` and the extension of `SingleGrid` and `MultiGrid` classes to support cell properties mark a significant enhancement in Mesa's environmental modeling capabilities. It allows to add different layers of variables to grids, that can be used to represent spatial environmental properties, such as elevation, pollution, flood levels or foliage.

**Key features:**
- Efficient management of environmental properties like terrain types and resources.
- Dynamic interaction between agents and their environment.
- Fast modification and selection of cells based on one or multiple properties

**Example:**
```Python
from mesa.space import SingleGrid, PropertyLayer

grid = SingleGrid(10, 10, False)
property_layer = PropertyLayer("elevation", 10, 10, default_value=0)
grid.add_property_layer(property_layer)

# Modify multiple cells values
grid.properties["elevation"].modify_cells(np.multiply, 2)

# Select cells that have an elevation of at least 50
high_elevation_cells = grid.properties["elevation"].select_cells(condition=lambda x: x > 50)
```
_The PropertyLayer is an experimental feature. We would love feedback on it in #1932._

### 🧪 DiscreteEventScheduler (PR #1890)
The `DiscreteEventScheduler` is an innovative addition to the Mesa time module, tailored for discrete event simulations. This scheduler advances simulations based on specific event timings rather than regular intervals, providing more flexibility in modeling complex systems.

**Key Features:**
- Efficient handling of events scheduled for specific simulation times.
- Randomized execution order for events scheduled at the same time.

_The DiscreteEventScheduler is an experimental feature. We would love feedback on it in #1923._

where custom user-specified portrayal images don\'t load in the
visualization server.

# 1.1.0 (2022-10-10) Safford

**Special notes**

-   Perf: ContinuousSpace: speed-up add/remove agents #1376. This is a
    \~6x performance improvement for add/remove.
-   fix: time: Recompute agent_keys between stages #1391. This is a
    correctness fix for `SimultaneousActivation` and `StagedActivation`
    when agents are being removed during simulation.
-   ModularServer: Always set model.running = True on reset #1399. With
    this change, specifying `self.running = True` in your model
    `__init__` is now optional. Mesa\'s visualization server will
    automatically sets it to `True` in the beginning of a simulation.
-   feat: Allow user-specified local dir to be served by Tornado #1435.
    This simplifies the usage of `ModularServer` in Mesa-Geo.
-   Allow batch_run to take arbitrary parameters #1413. With this
    change, you can finally use any arbitrary Python objects as
    `batch_run` parameters, where previously they are restricted to
    hashable objects only.
-   Prevent seed and random from being shared between instances #1439.
    With this fix, a model instance has their own isolated RNG.
