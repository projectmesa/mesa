# Virus on a Network

## Summary

This model is based on the NetLogo model "Virus on Network".

For more information about this model, read the NetLogo's web page: http://ccl.northwestern.edu/netlogo/models/VirusonaNetwork.

JavaScript library used in this example to render the network: [d3.js](https://d3js.org/).

## Installation

To install the dependencies use pip and the requirements.txt in this directory. e.g.

```
    $ pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## How to Run

To run the model interactively, run ``mesa runserver`` in this directory. e.g.

```
    $ mesa runserver
```

Then open your browser to [http://127.0.0.1:8521/](http://127.0.0.1:8521/) and press Reset, then Run.

## Files

* ``run.py``: Launches a model visualization server.
* ``model.py``: Contains the agent class, and the overall model class.
* ``server.py``: Defines classes for visualizing the model (network layout) in the browser via Mesa's modular server, and instantiates a visualization server.
