[Mesa] is an Apache2 licensed agent-based modeling (or ABM) framework in Python.

Mesa allows users to quickly create agent-based models using built-in core components (such as spatial grids and agent schedulers) or customized implementations; visualize them using a browser-based interface; and analyze their results using Python's data analysis tools. Mesa's goal is to make simulations accessible to everyone, so humanity can more effectively understand and solve complex problems.

## Features

- Built-in core modeling components
- Flexible agent and model management through AgentSet
- Browser-based Solara visualization
- Built-in tools for data collection and analysis
- Example model library

## Using Mesa
### Installation Options
To install our latest stable release, run:

```bash
pip install -U mesa
```
To also install our recommended dependencies:
```bash
pip install -U "mesa[rec]"
```

The `[rec]` option installs additional recommended dependencies needed for visualization, plotting, and network modeling capabilities.

Note: On macOS with zsh, the square brackets `[rec]` are interpreted as glob patterns by the shell. Always use quotes as shown in the command above to prevent shell expansion errors.

Furthermore, if you are using `nix`, Mesa comes with a flake with devShells and a runnable app:

```bash
nix run github:project-mesa/mesa # for default Python shell
```

For development shell, clone the repository and run the following command from
repository root:

```bash
nix develop .#uv2nix # pure shell
```
