[Mesa] is an Apache2 licensed agent-based modeling (or ABM) framework in Python.

Mesa allows users to quickly create agent-based models using built-in core components (such as spatial grids and agent schedulers) or customized implementations; visualize them using a browser-based interface; and analyze their results using Python's data analysis tools. Its goal is to be the Python-based counterpart to NetLogo, Repast, or MASON.

## Features

- Built-in core modeling components
- Flexible agent and model management through AgentSet
- Browser-based Solara visualization
- Built-in tools for data collection and analysis
- Example model library

## Using Mesa
### Installation Options
To install our latest stable release (3.1.x), run:

```bash
pip install -U mesa
```
To also install our recommended dependencies:
```bash
pip install -U mesa[rec]
```

On a Mac, this command might cause an error stating `zsh: no matches found: mesa[all]`.
In that case, change the command to `pip install -U "mesa[rec]"`.
