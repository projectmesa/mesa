Mesa Packages 
==============

		*Bottom up models are virtual laboratories where controlled experiments distinguish noise from signal in the systems organization....
		This approach may change our whole notion of scientific theory, which until now has been based on the theories of physics. Theories of
		complex systems may never be reducible to simple analytical equations, but are more likely to be sets of conceptually simple mechanisms
		(e.g. Darwinian natural selection) that produce different dynamics and outcomes in different contexts.*

The Mesa core functionality is just a subset of what we believe researchers creating Agent Based Models (ABMs) will use. We designed Mesa to be extensible, so that individuals from various domains can build and maintain their own Mesa packages in pursuit of "unifying algorithmic theories of the relation between adaptive behavior and system complexity."

The purpose of this guide is to support new programmers by providing detailed guides on "How to" build and share a package. Let's get started!

	You want add to create your package but have never done it before -- start here: :ref:`package-development`

	You want to incorporate a package from a MESA user but don't know how--- try this: :ref:`user-guide`

	`See links to shared Mesa packages <https://github.com/projectmesa/mesa/wiki>`_
