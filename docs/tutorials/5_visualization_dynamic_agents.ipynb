    "### Adding visualization\n",
    "\n",
    "So far, we've built a model, run it, and analyzed some output afterwards. However, one of the advantages of agent-based models is that we can often watch them run step by step, potentially spotting unexpected patterns, behaviors or bugs, or developing new intuitions, hypotheses, or insights. Other times, watching a model run can explain it to an unfamiliar audience better than static explanations. Like many ABM frameworks, Mesa allows you to create an interactive visualization of the model. In this section we'll walk through creating a visualization using built-in components, and (for advanced users) how to create a new visualization element.\n",
    "\n",
    "First, a quick explanation of how Mesa's interactive visualization works. The visualization is done in a browser window or Jupyter instance, using the [Solara](https://solara.dev/) framework, a pure Python, React-style web framework. Running `solara run app.py` will launch a web server, which runs the model, and displays model detail at each step via a plotting library. Alternatively, you can execute everything inside a Jupyter instance and display it inline."

    "In the first visualization, all we could see is the agents moving around -- but not how much money they had, or anything else of interest. In this tutorial let's change it so that agents are represented by the units of wealth they have. So those who are broke (wealth 0) are drawn in red, smaller. \n",
    "\n",
    "As Mesa is open source, it is important to point out that currently, we can't direct the drawing order of the circles, so a broke agent may be overshadowed by a wealthy agent. If you have some ideas, please feel free to [contribute](https://github.com/projectmesa/mesa/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md). \n",
    "\n",
    "In addition to size and color, an agent's shape can also be customized when using the default drawer. The allowed values for shapes can be found [here](https://matplotlib.org/stable/api/markers_api.html).\n",
