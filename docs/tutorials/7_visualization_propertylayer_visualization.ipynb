    "### Adding visualization\n",
    "\n",
    "So far, we've built a model, run it, and analyzed some output afterwards. However, one of the advantages of agent-based models is that we can often watch them run step by step, potentially spotting unexpected patterns, behaviors or bugs, or developing new intuitions, hypotheses, or insights. Other times, watching a model run can explain it to an unfamiliar audience better than static explanations. Like many ABM frameworks, Mesa allows you to create an interactive visualization of the model. In this section we'll walk through creating a visualization using built-in components, and (for advanced users) how to create a new visualization element.\n",
    "\n",
    "First, a quick explanation of how Mesa's interactive visualization works. The visualization is done in a browser window or Jupyter instance, using the [Solara](https://solara.dev/) framework, a pure Python, React-style web framework. Running `solara run app.py` will launch a web server, which runs the model, and displays model detail at each step via a plotting library. Alternatively, you can execute everything inside a Jupyter instance and display it inline."

    "## Visualizing Property Layers\n",
    "\n",
    "> **⚠️ Important:**\n",
    "> Property layer visualization on `HexGrid` is not supported with the `altair` backend; use `matplotlib` instead.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can visualize **property layers** in a way that's very similar to how agents are visualized—by defining a custom portrayal function. Let’s call this function `propertylayer_portrayal`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Mesa provides a dedicated component for property layer styling, called `PropertyLayerStyle` (similar to `AgentPortrayalStyle` for agents). You can import it from `mesa.visualization.components` as shown earlier.\n",
    "\n",
    "In `PropertyLayerStyle`, you can define:\n",
    "\n",
    "* `color` or `colormap`: Determines how the values in the layer are visualized\n",
    "* `alpha`: Controls the transparency (opacity) of the layer\n",
    "* `colorbar`: A boolean that determines whether a colorbar is shown alongside the visualization\n",
    "* `vmin` and `vmax`: The minimum and maximum data values to be visualized, controlling the color scale range, these default to the minimum and maximum values in your data respectively if not defined.\n",
    "\n",
    "The portrayal function receives a `layer` object as an argument, just like how `agent_portrayal` receives an `agent`. If your model includes multiple property layers, you can conditionally adjust the visualization logic based on the `layer.name` field. This allows you to apply different styles to each layer as needed.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here’s a quick example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def propertylayer_portrayal(layer):\n",
    "    if layer.name == \"WealthDensity\":\n",
    "        return PropertyLayerStyle(\n",
    "            colormap=\"viridis\",\n",
    "            alpha=0.6,\n",
    "            colorbar=True,\n",
    "            vmin=0,\n",
    "            vmax=10,\n",
    "        )\n",
    "    elif layer.name == \"Temperature\":\n",
    "        return PropertyLayerStyle(\n",
    "            colormap=\"coolwarm\",\n",
    "            alpha=0.5,\n",
    "            colorbar=False,\n",

    "            vmax=1,\n",
    "        )\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This approach allows you to customize each property layer’s appearance independently while keeping your visualization code clean and modular.\n",
