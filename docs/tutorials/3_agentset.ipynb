    "## Agent Management Through AgentSet\n",
    "\n",
    "**Background:** Mesa uses a set based approach, [AgentSet](https://github.com/projectmesa/mesa/blob/f511a4bc57340cb2dd0ba4b0af76307b37aea0ca/mesa/agent.py#L147) to allow users efficiently and intuitively manage their agents.  For the most part users will never explicitly call AgentSet and in fact, we have already used the AgentSet methods functionality when we used `shuffle_do(move)` to reorder the agents and then `do(exchange)` to have the agents exchange money in sequence. Although you will likely never interact with AgentSent directly it is important to know the Mesa uses a set based approach for agent management. \n",
    "\n",
    "Beyond the method functionality there are additional ways AgentSet can help you manage your agents and we will look at two additional examples in this tutorial, but you can see more in the [Getting Started Section of Mesa](https://mesa.readthedocs.io/stable/getting_started.html#agentset-functionality). \n",
    "\n",
    "**Model-specific information:** We will show two agent management techniques just to demonstrate the capability\n",
    "1. **Selecting** We will institute a policy that has the rich agents give money to the  poor agents\n",
    "2. **GroupBy** We will group agents together based on wealth\n",
