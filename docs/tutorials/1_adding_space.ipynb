    "## Adding space\n",
    "\n",
    "**Background:** Due to the complex dynamics of space and movement, Mesa offers a wide range space options and has built a structure to allow for the addition of even more spaces or custom user space creation. (Please contribute to Mesa if you develop a new space that can add to user options.)\n",
    "\n",
    "The two main approaches to space are discrete space (think cells or nodes that agents occupy) and continuous space (agents can occupy any location(s) in a three-dimensional space). Continuous space is still experimental as we continue to develop it.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Overview of Discrete Space:** For this tutorial we will be using discrete space in the classic cartesian coordinated system. As indicated in the diagram discrete space is made up of two modules. Cells and Cell Agents. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Cells:**\n",
    "The cell class represents a location that can:\n",
    "- Have properties (like temperature or resources)\n",
    "- Track and limit the agents it contains\n",
    "- Connect to neighboring cells\n",
    "- Provide neighborhood information\n",
    "\n",
    "Cells form the foundation of the cell space system, enabling rich spatial environments where both location properties and agent behaviors matter. They're useful for modeling things like varying terrain, infrastructure capacity, or environmental conditions.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Cell Agents:**\n",
    "Agents that understand how to exist in and move through cell spaces.\n",
    "\n",
    "Cell Agents are specialized agent classes that handle cell occupation, movement, and proper registration:\n",
    "- `CellAgent`: Mobile agents that can move between cells\n",
    "- `FixedAgent`: Immobile agents permanently fixed to cells\n",
    "- `Grid2DMovingAgent`: Agents with grid-specific movement capabilities\n",
    "\n",
    "These classes ensure consistent agent-cell relationships and proper state management as agents move through the space. They can be used directly or as examples for creating custom cell-aware agents.\n",
    "\n",
    "From these basic building blocks we can then add features to allow for different types of spaces and behaviors. To keep this tutorial concise we will not go through all of them, however, the current layout of discrete space is below as well as the different support modules. To find out more about the other options and what they can do, check out the [Discrete Space API](https://mesa.readthedocs.io/latest/apis/discrete_space.html)\n",

    "**Model-specific information:**  In addition to using discrete space, the agents will access their [Moore neighborhood](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moore_neighborhood). A Moore neighborhood means agents can interact with 8 neighbors.  Instead of giving their unit of money to any random agent, they'll give it to an agent on the same cell. For the Money model multiple agents can be in the same spaces and since they are on a torus the agents on the left side can exchange money with agent on the right. Agents on the top can exchange with agents on the bottom."
