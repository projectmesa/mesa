    "### Adding visualization\n",
    "\n",
    "So far, we've built a model, run it, and analyzed some output afterwards. However, one of the advantages of agent-based models is that we can often watch them run step by step, potentially spotting unexpected patterns, behaviors or bugs, or developing new intuitions, hypotheses, or insights. Other times, watching a model run can explain it to an unfamiliar audience better than static explanations. Like many ABM frameworks, Mesa allows you to create an interactive visualization of the model. In this section we'll walk through creating a visualization using built-in components, and (for advanced users) how to create a new visualization element.\n",
    "\n",
    "First, a quick explanation of how Mesa's interactive visualization works. Visualization is done in a browser window, using JavaScript to draw the different things being visualized at each step of the model. To do this, Mesa launches a small web server, which runs the model, turns each step into a JSON object (essentially, structured plain text) and sends those steps to the browser.\n",
    "\n",
    "A visualization is built up of a few different modules: for example, a module for drawing agents on a grid, and another one for drawing a chart of some variable. Each module has a Python part, which runs on the server and turns a model state into JSON data; and a JavaScript side, which takes that JSON data and draws it in the browser window. Mesa comes with a few modules built in, and let you add your own as well."

For this, you will need to put your model code in a separate Python source file; for example, `MoneyModel.py`. Next, either in the same file or in a new one (e.g. `MoneyModel_Viz.py`) import the server class and the Canvas Grid class (so-called because it uses HTML5 canvas to draw a grid). If you're in a new file, you'll also need to import the actual model object."

Note that the `render` method doesn't return a JSON string -- just an object that can be turned into JSON, in this case a Python list (with Python integers as the values; the `json` library doesn't like dealing with numpy's integer type).\n",
