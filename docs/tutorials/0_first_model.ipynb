    "[Mesa](https://github.com/projectmesa/mesa) is a Python framework for [agent-based modeling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agent-based_model). This tutorial is the first in a series of introductory tutorials that will assist you in getting started and discover some of the core features of Mesa.  The tutorial starts with the key pieces of a model and then progressively adds functionality. \n",

    "1. There are some number of agents.\n",

    "\n",
    "With the basics of the Agent class and Model class created we can now activate the agents to `do` things\n",
    "\n",
    "**Background:** Mesa's `do` function calls agent functions to grow your ABM. A step is the smallest unit of time in the model, and is often referred to as a tick. The `do` function and Python functionality can be configured to activate agents in different orders. This can be important as the order in which agents are activated can impact the results of the model [Comer2014]. At each step of the model, one or more of the agents -- usually all of them -- are activated and take their own step, changing internally and/or interacting with one another or the environment.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Model-specific information:** For this section we will randomly reorder the Agent activation order using  `mesa.Agent.shuffle_do` and have the agents `step` function print the agent's unique id that they were assigned during the agent creation process. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Code implementation:** Using standard ABM convention we add a `step` function to the `MoneyModel` class which calls the `mesa.Agent.shuffle_do` function. We then pass into `shuffle_do` the parameter \"step\". This tells mesa to look for and execute the `step` function in our MoneyAgent class.  "
