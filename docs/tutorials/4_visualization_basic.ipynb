    "### Adding visualization\n",
    "\n",
    "So far, we've built a model, run it, and analyzed some output afterwards. However, one of the advantages of agent-based models is that we can often watch them run step by step, potentially spotting unexpected patterns, behaviors or bugs, or developing new intuitions, hypotheses, or insights. Other times, watching a model run can explain it to an unfamiliar audience better than static explanations. Like many ABM frameworks, Mesa allows you to create an interactive visualization of the model. In this section we'll walk through creating a visualization using built-in components, and (for advanced users) how to create a new visualization element.\n",
    "\n",
    "First, a quick explanation of how Mesa's interactive visualization works. The visualization is done in a browser window or Jupyter instance, using the [Solara](https://solara.dev/) framework, a pure Python, React-style web framework. Running `solara run app.py` will launch a web server, which runs the model, and displays model detail at each step via a plotting library. Alternatively, you can execute everything inside a Jupyter instance and display it inline."

A portrayal is a dictionary (which can easily be turned into a JSON object) which tells Matplotlib the color and size of the scatterplot markers (each signifying an agent). The only thing we need to provide is a function which takes an agent, and returns a portrayal dictionary. Here's the simplest one: it'll draw each agent as a blue, filled circle, with a radius size of 50."
