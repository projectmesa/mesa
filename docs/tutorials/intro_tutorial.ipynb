    "\n",
    "[Mesa](https://github.com/projectmesa/mesa) is a Python framework for [agent-based modeling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agent-based_model). This tutorial will assist you in getting started. Working through the tutorial will help you discover the core features of Mesa.  Through the tutorial, you are walked through creating a starter-level model. Functionality is added progressively as the process unfolds. Should anyone find any errors, bugs, have a suggestion, or just are looking for clarification, [let us know](https://github.com/projectmesa/mesa/issues)!\n",
    "\n",
    "The premise of this tutorial is to create a starter-level model representing agents exchanging money. This exchange of money affects wealth. \n",
    "\n",
    "Next, *space* is added to allow agents to move based on the change in wealth as time progresses.\n",
    "\n",
    "Two of Mesa's analytic tools: the *data collector* and *batch runner* are then used to examine the dynamics of this simple model. \n",

The scheduler is also responsible for advancing the model by one step. A step is the smallest unit of time in the model, and is often referred to as a tick. The scheduler can be configured to activate agents in different orders. This can be important as the order in which agents are activated can impact the results of the model [Comer2014]. At each step of the model, one or more of the agents -- usually all of them -- are activated and take their own step, changing internally and/or interacting with one another or the environment.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Model-specific information:** A new class is named `RandomActivationByAgent` is created which extends `mesa.time.RandomActivation` creating a subclass of  the `RandomActivation` class from Mesa. This class activates all the agents once per step, in random order. Every agent is expected to have a ``step`` method. The step method is the action the agent takes when it is activated by the model schedule. We add an agent to the schedule using the `add` method; when we call the schedule's `step` method, the model shuffles the order of the agents, then activates and executes each agent's ```step``` method. The scheduler is then added to the model.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Code implementation:** The technical details about the timer object can be found in the [mesa repo](https://github.com/projectmesa/mesa/blob/main/mesa/time.py). Mesa offers a few different built-in scheduler classes, with a common interface. That makes it easy to change the activation regime a given model uses, and see whether it changes the model behavior. The details pertaining to the scheduler interface can be located in the same [mesa repo](https://github.com/projectmesa/mesa/blob/main/mesa/time.py).\n",

    "\n",
    "Many ABMs have a spatial element, with agents moving around and interacting with nearby neighbors. Mesa currently supports two overall kinds of spaces: grid, and continuous. Grids are divided into cells, and agents can only be on a particular cell, like pieces on a chess board. Continuous space, in contrast, allows agents to have any arbitrary position. Both grids and continuous spaces are frequently [toroidal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toroidal_graph), meaning that the edges wrap around, with cells on the right edge connected to those on the left edge, and the top to the bottom. This prevents some cells having fewer neighbors than others, or agents being able to go off the edge of the environment.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's add a simple spatial element to our model by putting our agents on a grid and make them walk around at random. Instead of giving their unit of money to any random agent, they'll give it to an agent on the same cell.\n",
    "\n",
    "Mesa has two main types of grids: `SingleGrid` and `MultiGrid`*. `SingleGrid` enforces at most one agent per cell; `MultiGrid` allows multiple agents to be in the same cell. Since we want agents to be able to share a cell, we use `MultiGrid`.\n",
    "\n",
    "*However there are more types of space to include `HexGrid`, `NetworkGrid`, and the previously mentioned `ContinuousSpace`. Similar to `mesa.time` context is retained with `mesa.space.[enter class]`. You can inspect the different classes at [mesa.space](https://github.com/projectmesa/mesa/blob/main/mesa/space.py)."

It also needs an argument as to whether to include the center cell itself as one of the neighbors.\n",
    "\n",

    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, we need to get all the other agents present in a cell, and give one of them some money. We can get the contents of one or more cells using the grid's `get_cell_list_contents` method, or by accessing a cell directly. The method accepts a list of cell coordinate tuples, or a single tuple if we only care about one cell.\n",

    "            self.wealth -= 1\n",
    "```\n",

Both then return a value computed from the model or each agent at their current state. When the data collector’s `collect` method is called, with a model object as its argument, it applies each model-level collection function to the model, and stores the results in a dictionary, associating the current value with the current step of the model.
