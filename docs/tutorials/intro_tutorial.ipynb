    "With the basics of the Agent class and Model class created we can now activate the agents to `do` things\n",
    "\n",
    "**Background:** Mesa's `do` function calls agent functions to grow your ABM. A step is the smallest unit of time in the model, and is often referred to as a tick. The `do` function and Python functionality can be configured to activate agents in different orders. This can be important as the order in which agents are activated can impact the results of the model [Comer2014]. At each step of the model, one or more of the agents -- usually all of them -- are activated and take their own step, changing internally and/or interacting with one another or the environment.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Model-specific information:** For this section we will randomly reorder the Agent activation order using  `mesa.Agent.shuffle_do` and have the agents `step` function print the agent's unique id that they were assigned during the agent creation process. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Code implementation:** Using standard ABM convention we add a `step` function to the `MoneyModel` class which calls the `mesa.Agent.shuffle_do` function. We then pass into `shuffle_do` the parameter \"step\". This tells mesa to look for and execute the `step` function in our MoneyAgent class.  "

    "**Background:** Many ABMs have a spatial element, with agents moving around and interacting with nearby neighbors. Mesa has several types of [spaces](https://mesa.readthedocs.io/latest/apis/space.html) from different types of grids to networks to an in development [cell_space](https://mesa.readthedocs.io/latest/apis/experimental.html#module-experimental.cell_space.__init__). Mesa grids are divided into cells, and agents can only be on a particular cell, like pieces on a chess board. Continuous space, in contrast, allows agents to have any arbitrary position. (Think of grids vs continuous space like the difference between integers and decimals).\n",
    "\n",
    "Both grids and continuous spaces are frequently [toroidal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toroidal_graph), meaning that the edges wrap around, with cells on the right edge connected to those on the left edge, and the top to the bottom. This prevents some cells having fewer neighbors than others, or agents being able to go off the edge of the environment. You can envision a torous by thinking of donut.\n",
    "\n",
    "Mesa has two main types of grids: `SingleGrid` and `MultiGrid`. `SingleGrid` enforces at most one agent per cell; `MultiGrid` allows multiple agents to be in the same cell. We are going to use `MultiGrid` and then only exchange money with agents in the same cell.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Model-specific information:** Let's add a simple spatial element to our model by putting our agents on a grid and make them walk around at random. Instead of giving their unit of money to any random agent, they'll give it to an agent on the same cell. For the Money model multiple agents can be in the same spaces and since they are on a torus the agents on the left side can exchange money with agent on the right. Agents on the top can exchange with agents on the bottom.\n",

    "\n",
    "First let's handle movement, and have the agents move to a neighboring cell. The grid object provides a `move_agent` method, which like you'd imagine, moves an agent to a given cell. That still leaves us to get the possible neighboring cells to move to. There are a couple ways to do this. One is to use the current coordinates, and loop over all coordinates +/- 1 away from it. For example:\n",

    "        neighbors.append((x+dx, y+dy))\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "But there's an even simpler way, using the grid's built-in `get_neighborhood` method, which returns all the neighbors of a given cell. This method can get two types of cell neighborhoods: [Moore](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moore_neighborhood) (includes all 8 surrounding squares), and [Von neumann](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Von_neumann_neighborhood)(only up/down/left/right). It also needs an argument as to whether to include the center cell itself as one of the neighbors.\n",
    "\n",
    "With that in mind, the agent's `move` method looks like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "class MoneyAgent(mesa.Agent):\n",
    "   #...\n",
    "    def move(self):\n",
    "        possible_steps = self.model.grid.get_neighborhood(\n",

    "        self.model.grid.move_agent(self, new_position)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, we need to get all the other agents present in a cell, and give one of them some money. We can get the contents of one or more cells using the grid's `get_cell_list_contents` method, or by accessing a cell directly. The method accepts a list of cell coordinate tuples, or a single tuple if we only care about one cell.\n",
