    "## Tutorial Description\n",
    "\n",
    "[Mesa](https://github.com/projectmesa/mesa) is a Python framework for [agent-based modeling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agent-based_model).  Getting started with Mesa is easy. In this tutorial, we will walk through creating a simple model and progressively add functionality which will illustrate Mesa's core features.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note:** This tutorial is a work-in-progress. If you find any errors or bugs, or just find something unclear or confusing, [let us know](https://github.com/projectmesa/mesa/issues)!\n",
    "\n",
    "The base for this tutorial is a very simple model of agents exchanging money. Next, we add *space* to allow agents to move. Then, we'll cover two of Mesa's analytic tools: the *data collector* and *batch runner*. After that, we'll add an *interactive visualization* which lets us watch the model as it runs. Finally, we go over how to write your own visualization module, for users who are comfortable with JavaScript.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can also find all the code this tutorial describes in the **examples/boltzmann_wealth_model** directory of the Mesa repository."

    "## Sample Model Description\n",
    "\n",
    "The tutorial model is a very simple simulated agent-based economy, drawn from econophysics and presenting a statistical mechanics approach to wealth distribution [Dragulescu2002]. The rules of our tutorial model:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. There are some number of agents.\n",
    "2. All agents begin with 1 unit of money.\n",
    "3. At every step of the model, an agent gives 1 unit of money (if they have it) to some other agent.\n",
    "\n",
    "Despite its simplicity, this model yields results that are often unexpected to those not familiar with it. For our purposes, it also easily demonstrates Mesa's core features.\n",

    "### Installation\n",
    "\n",
    "To start, install Mesa. We recommend doing this in a [virtual environment](https://virtualenvwrapper.readthedocs.org/en/stable/), but make sure your environment is set up with Python 3. Mesa requires Python3 and does not work in Python 2 environments.\n",
    "\n",
    "To install Mesa, simply:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "    $ pip install --upgrade mesa\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "When you do that, it will install Mesa itself, as well as any dependencies that aren't in your setup yet. Additional dependencies required by this tutorial can be found in the **examples/boltzmann_wealth_model/requirements.txt** file, which can be installed directly form the github repository by running:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "    $ pip install --upgrade -r https://github.com/projectmesa/mesa-examples/blob/main/examples/boltzmann_wealth_model_network/requirements.txt\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This will install the dependencies listed in the requirements.txt file which are:  \n",
    "- mesa (this ABM library -- if not installed)\n",

    "## Building a sample model\n",

    "Once Mesa is installed, you can start building our model. You can write models in two different ways:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Write the code in its own file with your favorite text editor, or\n",
    "2. Write the model interactively in [Jupyter Notebook](http://jupyter.org/) cells.\n",
    "\n",
    "Either way, it's good practice to put your model in its own folder -- especially if the project will end up consisting of multiple files (for example, Python files for the model and the visualization, a Notebook for analysis, and a Readme with some documentation and discussion).\n",

    "### Setting up the model\n",
    "\n",
    "To begin writing the model code, we start with two core classes: one for the overall model, the other for the agents. The model class holds the model-level attributes, manages the agents, and generally handles the global level of our model. Each instantiation of the model class will be a specific model run. Each model will contain multiple agents, all of which are instantiations of the agent class. Both the model and agent classes are child classes of Mesa's generic `Model` and `Agent` classes. This is seen in the code with `class MoneyModel(mesa.Model)` or `class MoneyAgent(mesa.Agent)`. If you want you can specifically the class being imported by looking at the [model](https://github.com/projectmesa/mesa/blob/main/mesa/model.py) or [agent](https://github.com/projectmesa/mesa/blob/main/mesa/agent.py) code in the mesa repo.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each agent has only one variable: how much wealth it currently has. (Each agent will also have a unique identifier (i.e., a name), stored in the `unique_id` variable. Giving each agent a unique id is a good practice when doing agent-based modeling.)\n",
    "\n",
    "There is only one model-level parameter: how many agents the model contains. When a new model is started, we want it to populate itself with the given number of agents.\n",
    "\n",

    "### Adding the scheduler\n",
    "\n",
    "Time in most agent-based models moves in steps, sometimes also called **ticks**. At each step of the model, one or more of the agents -- usually all of them -- are activated and take their own step, changing internally and/or interacting with one another or the environment.\n",
    "\n",
    "The **scheduler** is a special model component which controls the order in which agents are activated. For example, all the agents may activate in the same order every step; their order might be shuffled; we may try to simulate all the agents acting at the same time; and more. Mesa offers a few different built-in scheduler classes, with a common interface. That makes it easy to change the activation regime a given model uses, and see whether it changes the model behavior. This may not seem important, but scheduling patterns can have an impact on your results [Comer2014].\n",
    "\n",
    "For now, let's use one of the simplest ones: `RandomActivation`*, which activates all the agents once per step, in random order. Every agent is expected to have a ``step`` method. The step method is the action the agent takes when it is activated by the model schedule. We add an agent to the schedule using the `add` method; when we call the schedule's `step` method, the model shuffles the order of the agents, then activates and executes each agent's ```step``` method.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Unlike `mesa.model` or `mesa.agent`, `mesa.time` has multiple classes (e.g. `RandomActivation`, `StagedActivation` etc). To ensure context, time is used in the import as evidenced below with `mesa.time.Randomactivation`.  You can see the different time classes as [mesa.time](https://github.com/projectmesa/mesa/blob/main/mesa/time.py). \n",

Grids are divided into cells, and agents can only be on a particular cell, like pieces on a chess board. Continuous space, in contrast, allows agents to have any arbitrary position. Both grids and continuous spaces are frequently [toroidal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toroidal_graph), meaning that the edges wrap around, with cells on the right edge connected to those on the left edge, and the top to the bottom. This prevents some cells having fewer neighbors than others, or agents being able to go off the edge of the environment.\n",

    "Under the hood, each agent's position is stored in two ways: the agent is contained in the grid in the cell it is currently in, and the agent has a `pos` variable with an (x, y) coordinate tuple. The `place_agent` method adds the coordinate to the agent automatically.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now we need to add to the agents' behaviors, letting them move around and only give money to other agents in the same cell.\n",
    "\n",
    "First let's handle movement, and have the agents move to a neighboring cell. The grid object provides a `move_agent` method, which like you'd imagine, moves an agent to a given cell. That still leaves us to get the possible neighboring cells to move to. There are a couple ways to do this. One is to use the current coordinates, and loop over all coordinates +/- 1 away from it. For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "neighbors = []\n",
    "x, y = self.pos\n",
    "for dx in [-1, 0, 1]:\n",
    "    for dy in [-1, 0, 1]:\n",
    "        neighbors.append((x+dx, y+dy))\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "But there's an even simpler way, using the grid's built-in `get_neighborhood` method, which returns all the neighbors of a given cell. This method can get two types of cell neighborhoods: [Moore](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moore_neighborhood) (includes all 8 surrounding squares), and [Von Neumann](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Von_Neumann_neighborhood)(only up/down/left/right). It also needs an argument as to whether to include the center cell itself as one of the neighbors.\n",
    "\n",
    "With that in mind, the agent's `move` method looks like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "class MoneyAgent(mesa.Agent):\n",
    "   #...\n",
    "    def move(self):\n",
    "        possible_steps = self.model.grid.get_neighborhood(\n",

    "        new_position = self.random.choice(possible_steps)\n",
    "        self.model.grid.move_agent(self, new_position)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, we need to get all the other agents present in a cell, and give one of them some money. We can get the contents of one or more cells using the grid's `get_cell_list_contents` method, or by accessing a cell directly. The method accepts a list of cell coordinate tuples, or a single tuple if we only care about one cell.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "class MoneyAgent(mesa.Agent):\n",
    "    #...\n",
    "    def give_money(self):\n",
    "        cellmates = self.model.grid.get_cell_list_contents([self.pos])\n",
    "        if len(cellmates) > 1:\n",
    "            other = self.random.choice(cellmates)\n",
    "            other.wealth += 1\n",
    "            self.wealth -= 1\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "And with those two methods, the agent's ``step`` method becomes:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "class MoneyAgent(mesa.Agent):\n",
    "    # ...\n",
    "    def step(self):\n",

    "So far, at the end of every model run, we've had to go and write our own code to get the data out of the model. This has two problems: it isn't very efficient, and it only gives us end results. If we wanted to know the wealth of each agent at each step, we'd have to add that to the loop of executing steps, and figure out some way to store the data.\n",

    "The data collector stores three categories of data: model-level variables, agent-level variables, and tables (which are a catch-all for everything else). Model- and agent-level variables are added to the data collector along with a function for collecting them. Model-level collection functions take a model object as an input, while agent-level collection functions take an agent object as an input. Both then return a value computed from the model or each agent at their current state. When the data collector’s `collect` method is called, with a model object as its argument, it applies each model-level collection function to the model, and stores the results in a dictionary, associating the current value with the current step of the model. Similarly, the method applies each agent-level collection function to each agent currently in the schedule, associating the resulting value with the step of the model, and the agent’s `unique_id`.\n",

At the agent level, we want to collect every agent's wealth at every step.

    "Many other analysis are possible based on the policies, scenarios and uncertainties that you might be interested in. In general, you can follow these steps to do your own analysis:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Determine which metrics you want to analyse. Add these as model and agent reporters to the datacollector of your model.\n",
    "2. Determine the input parameters you want to vary. Add these as parameters to the batch_run function, using ranges or lists to test different values.\n",
    "3. Determine the hyperparameters of the batch_run function. Define the number of iterations, the number of processes, the number of steps, the data collection period, etc.\n",
    "4. Run the batch_run function and save the results.\n",
    "5. Transform, filter and aggregate the results to get the data you want to analyze. Make sure it's in long format, so that each row represents a single value.\n",
    "6. Choose a plot type, what to plot on the x and y axis, which columns to use for the hue. Seaborn also has an amazing [Example Gallery](https://seaborn.pydata.org/examples/index.html).\n",
    "7. Plot the data and analyze the results."
