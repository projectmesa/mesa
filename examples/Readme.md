# Example Code
This directory contains example models meant to test and demonstrate Mesa's features, and provide demonstrations for how to build and analyze agent-based models. For more information on each model, see its own Readme and documentation.

## Models

Classic models, some of which can be found in NetLogo's/MASON's example models.

### bank_reserves
A highly abstracted, simplified model of an economy, with only one type of agent and a single bank representing all banks in an economy.

### color_patches
A cellular automaton model where agents opinions are influenced by that of their neighbors. As the model evolves, color patches representing the prevailing opinion in a given area expand, contract, and sometimes disappear.

### conways_game_of_life
Implementation of [Conway's Game of Life](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life), a cellular automata where simple rules can give rise to complex patterns.

### epstein_civil_violence
Joshua Epstein's [model](http://www.uvm.edu/~pdodds/files/papers/others/2002/epstein2002a.pdf) of how a decentralized uprising can be suppressed or reach a critical mass of support.

### boid_flockers
[Boids](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boids)-style flocking model, demonstrating the use of agents moving through a continuous space following direction vectors.

### forest_fire
Simple cellular automata of a fire spreading through a forest of cells on a grid, based on the NetLogo [Fire model](http://ccl.northwestern.edu/netlogo/models/Fire).

### hex_snowflake
Conway's game of life on a hexagonal grid.

### pd_grid
Grid-based demographic prisoner's dilemma model, demonstrating how simple mimicing can lead to the emergence of widespread cooperation -- and how a model activation regime can change its outcome.

### schelling (GUI and Text)
Mesa implementation of the classic [Schelling segregation model](http://nifty.stanford.edu/2014/mccown-schelling-model-segregation/).

### boltzmann_wealth_model
Completed code to go along with the [tutorial]() on making a simple model of how a highly-skewed wealth distribution can emerge from simple rules.

### wolf_sheep
Implementation of an ecological model of predation and reproduction, based on the NetLogo [Wolf Sheep Predation model](http://ccl.northwestern.edu/netlogo/models/WolfSheepPredation).

### sugarscape_cg
Implementation of Sugarscape 2 Constant Growback model, based on the Netlogo
[Sugarscape 2 Constant Growback](http://ccl.northwestern.edu/netlogo/models/Sugarscape2ConstantGrowback)

### virus_on_network
This model is based on the NetLogo model "Virus on Network".

## Feature examples

Example models specifically for demonstrating Mesa's features.

### charts

A modified version of the "bank_reserves" example made to provide examples of mesa's charting tools.

### Shape Example
Example of grid display and direction showing agents in the form of arrow-head shape.
