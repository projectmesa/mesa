    The agent follows three behaviors to flock:
        - Cohesion: steering towards neighboring agents
        - Separation: avoiding getting too close to any other agent
        - Alignment: trying to fly in the same direction as neighbors

    Boids have a vision that defines the radius in which they look for their
    neighbors to flock with. Their speed (a scalar) and direction (a vector)
    define their movement. Separation is their desired minimum distance from
    any other Boid.
