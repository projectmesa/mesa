# Demographic Prisoner's Dilemma on a Grid

## Summary

The Demographic Prisoner's Dilemma is a family of variants on the classic two-player [Prisoner's Dilemma]. The model consists of agents, each with a strategy of either Cooperate or Defect. Each agent's payoff is based on its strategy and the strategies of its spatial neighbors. After each step of the model, the agents adopt the strategy of their neighbor with the highest total score.

The model payoff table is:

|               | Cooperate | Defect|
|:-------------:|:---------:|:-----:|
| **Cooperate** | 1, 1      | 0, D  |
| **Defect**    | D, 0      | 0, 0  |

Where *D* is the defection bonus, generally set higher than 1. In these runs, the defection bonus is set to $D=1.6$.

The Demographic Prisoner's Dilemma demonstrates how simple rules can lead to the emergence of widespread cooperation, despite the Defection strategy dominating each individual interaction game. However, it is also interesting for another reason: it is known to be sensitive to the activation regime employed in it.

## How to Run

To run the model interactively, in this directory, run the following command

```
    $ solara run app.py
```

## Files

* ``agents.py``: contains the agent class.
* ``model.py``: contains the model class; the model takes a ``activation_order`` string as an argument, which determines in which order agents are activated: Sequential, Random or Simultaneous.
* ``app.py``: contains the interactive visualization server.
* ``Demographic Prisoner's Dilemma Activation Schedule.ipynb``: Jupyter Notebook for running the scheduling experiment. This runs the model three times, one for each activation type, and demonstrates how the activation regime drives the model to different outcomes.
