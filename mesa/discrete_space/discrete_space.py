"""Base class for building cell-based spatial environments.

DiscreteSpace provides the core functionality needed by all cell-based spaces:
- Cell creation and tracking
- Agent-cell relationship management
- Property layer support
- Random selection capabilities
- Capacity management

This serves as the foundation for specific space implementations like grids
and networks, ensuring consistent behavior and shared functionality across
different space types. All concrete cell space implementations (grids, networks, etc.)
inherit from this class.
