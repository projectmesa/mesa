"""Cells are positions in space that can have properties and contain agents.

A cell represents a location that can:
- Have properties (like temperature or resources)
- Track and limit the agents it contains
- Connect to neighboring cells
- Provide neighborhood information

Cells form the foundation of the cell space system, enabling rich spatial
environments where both location properties and agent behaviors matter. They're
useful for modeling things like varying terrain, infrastructure capacity, or
environmental conditions.
