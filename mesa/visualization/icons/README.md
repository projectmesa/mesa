\# Mesa Agent Icon Library



This directory contains a minimal experimental set of symbolic SVG icons for use in Mesa visualizations.



\## Purpose

\- Provide optional agent icons similar in spirit to NetLogo shapes

\- Keep assets lightweight and performance-safe

\- Avoid any impact on core Mesa simulation logic



\## Current Scope (Performance Prototype)

\- 6 monochrome SVG icons

\- Categories: agents, vehicles, symbols



\## Design Constraints

\- Pure SVG

\- No filters, gradients, or raster images

\- Consistent stroke width and padding



\## Performance

These icons are static files and introduce no runtime processing logic. Performance impact is evaluated through a simple visualization benchmark.



\## License

All icons are original and released under the Mesa Apache-2.0 license.
